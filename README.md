# C & C++ Projects 💻⚡  

Welcome! 👋  

This repository contains all the **projects and programs** I’ve developed using **C and C++**.  
They cover everything from **fundamentals** to **advanced problem-solving** and **mini-projects**.  

## 📂 Repository Structure  
- `C/` → Programs and projects written in C  
  - Basics (loops, functions, arrays, strings)  
  - Pointers & memory management  
  - Structures, unions, and file handling  
  - Data structures (stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, graphs)  
  - Mini-projects in C  

- `C++/` → Programs and projects written in C++  
  - Core syntax and STL (vectors, maps, sets, etc.)  
  - Object-Oriented Programming (classes, inheritance, polymorphism, etc.)  
  - File handling & exception handling  
  - DSA implementations in C++  
  - Mini-projects in C++  

## 🎯 Purpose  
- Strengthen **C and C++ programming skills**.  
- Practice **problem-solving, OOP concepts, and DSA**.  
- Showcase projects and reference implementations.  

## ⚠️ Note  
- All programs are written in **pure C and C++**.  
- They can be compiled using standard compilers like `gcc` (for C) and `g++` (for C++).  

## 💡 Contribution  
Suggestions, bug fixes, or new project ideas are always welcome!
